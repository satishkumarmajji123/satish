sql joins: 
  
       joins are used to combine the rows based on a related column between them and the data type should 
be same.in joins we have

1)inner join: it returns the matching records from the both the tables.

         SELECT column_name(s)
         FROM table1
         INNER JOIN table2
         ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

2)left join: it returns all the records from left table and matching records from right table.

        SELECT column_name(s)
        FROM table1
        LEFT JOIN table2
        ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

3)right join: it returns all the records from right table and matching records from left table.

        SELECT column_name(s)
        FROM table1
        RIGHT JOIN table2
        ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
4)self join: a self join is regular join,but the table is joined with itself.

       SELECT column_name(s)
       FROM table1 T1, table1 T2
       WHERE condition; 

5)cross join: a cross join returns the cartesian product of rows from the rowsets in the join.

         SELECT column_name(s)
         FROM table1
         CROSS JOIN table2;
